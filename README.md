# supreme-octo-tribble

Part 2 Assumptions:
1. Transformers are sorted in descending order in each of their respective teams.
2. We list all the Transformers on the winning team regardless of whether they have been defeated or not.
3. In the event of a tie (i.e. each team has the same amount of defeats), we display the number of battles and the prompt, "No winners", as
there is no winning team or losing team to display.
4. Input for the Transformers data is valid and does not need to be validated (though there are SOME validations in place).
